Lesson 5 using Hardhat V2.26.3.
Steps 1 - 15. (working on a Macbook)

Notes: (I did Step 1 easily and then, after I did Step 2, Hardhat gave me a note saying: npx hardhat will be deprecated and suggested to use: npx hardhat init
So, I typed that suggested command: npx hardhat init and it gave me Hardhat 2.26.3. )
More Notes: (I had to use ls -a to show the hidden files in Step 11. I didn't realize some files were hidden. I saw them in VSCode but didn't see them when I looked at the list of files in the terminal. I was glad they were there after I ran ls -a to show the hidden files.)

Notes: 
I am also working this using Hardhat V3 beta because Hardhat V3 does not use tasks the same way. This lesson has been a challenge and a good learning process to know how to do the assignment using Hardhat V2 and Hardhat V3. I hope this helps others who got stuck with the Hardhat V2 vs V3 "creating a Task" issue.
